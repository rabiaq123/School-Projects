# CIS3110 (Operating Systems) Assignment 3
Dining Philosophers and Virtual Memory

This assignment contains two separate programs: 

1. One for implementing a solution to the **Dining Philosopher's problem**, and 
2. Another for writing a **simulator** that will take processes of varying sizes, load them into memory according to one of the four memory allocation strategies (Best Fit, Next Fit, Worst Fit, and First Fit), and swap them as needed to load other processes into memory.
